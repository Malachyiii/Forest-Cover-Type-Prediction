The difference in this case is how the trees are fit. Adaboost attempts to train each new tree by teaching it to be better at the examples that the previous tree got wrong. It does this by fitting weights to each example. The weights for each example go up when a tree gets them wrong, and go down when a tree gets them right. The objective function for each new tree respects these weights, and puts more emphasis on fitting these difficult examples correctly.\n",
